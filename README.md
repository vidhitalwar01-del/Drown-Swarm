# Drown-Swarm
This project implements a drone swarm system that enables multiple drones to coordinate, communicate, and execute tasks collaboratively. Inspired by swarm intelligence, the system models distributed decision-making, collision avoidance, and path planning to achieve collective behavior without centralized control.
The project demonstrates concepts of:
Multi-agent systems
Swarm intelligence algorithms (e.g., Boids, PSO, ACO, consensus control)
Real-time communication and synchronization
Path planning & obstacle avoidance
Cooperative task execution (e.g., formation flying, area coverage, target tracking)
